/*
For text, the D3DX library provides us with the ID3DXFont interface,
which works in a similar way to the ID3DXSprite interface.
You need to pass the D3DXCreateFont() function a standard GDI Font Handle
(HFONT), and in return you get a pointer to an ID3DXFont interface that has one
main function, DrawText(). This function mimics the GDI DrawTextEx() very
closely, such that the parameters are almost identical. In fact, the DirectX 8
SDK has a documentation error on the return value from this function, and the
actual return value is the same as in the GDI function -- the return value is
the text height of the drawn text. The visual quality and spacing of text output
from this function is excellent, and there are lots of formatting options, but
the drawback is speed. Under the hood, the ID3DXFont::DrawText() function
actually does what I discussed above, which is to create a GDI-compatible
bitmap, draw the text to the bitmap, and then copy the bitmap to textures, and
render the textures to the screen. So you get all the sluggishness of the
original GDI functions, combined with a lot of overhead -- in the end, this
function is up to 6 times slower than the original GDI DrawTextEx() was.
*/
/*
The DirectX 8 SDK provides a sample that offers a solution to this --
the "3D Text" sample program defines a class called CD3DFont,
which implements a much faster, though less robust, text solution.
It uses GDI only at the time of initialization to create a master texture of
available characters, which is then used to draw each individual character from
the texture, not requiring further calls to GDI. You lose some nice features
such as font kerning and formatting options, but you can always customize the
CD3DFont routines to meet your needs
